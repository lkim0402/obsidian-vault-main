Hi, Iâ€™m Leejun Kim â€” a CS undergrad at UW Seattle.

This space is my public notebook â€” a living collection of notes, thoughts, and things I'm learning.  A warning, it can get EXTREMELY messy and all over the place, as I tried to take down notes in literally anything I find confusing, or many things I am sure I will not remember (or mainly just useful to know stuff in general). There will be tons of topics ranging from frontend tools (like [[== React ==|React]], [[== CSS ==|CSS]], [[== JavaScript ==|JavaScript]], etc), backend ([[Express.js]], [[Node.js]], [[APIs]], etc), [[Linux]], and [[Cloud Computing|cloud computing]].

I use Obsidian for personal knowledge management, and I'm sharing parts of my vault here in the spirit of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

Expect to find:
- ðŸ“š Notes from books, papers, and courses
- ðŸ’¡ Half-baked ideas and projects-in-progress
- ðŸ§  Personal insights and things Iâ€™m still figuring out

Some pages are polished, others are just raw thoughts â€” but all of them reflect my journey as a student, developer, and researcher.
