1. Make sure the application is actually running lmao (actual common)
	- `npm start / npm run start `
2. Stop the app and restart (or just do a hard reload the browser)
3. Always keep the terminal in the project AND the chrome dev tools console in the browser
	- + react dev tools
4. google the exact error msg
5. always work with ESLint
6. if nothing works, just compare code with the final code
