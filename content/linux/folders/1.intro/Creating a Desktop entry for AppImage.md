Great! Since you've already made the AppImage executable, the next steps involve creating a desktop shortcut so you can easily launch Obsidian from your KDE environment. Here's how to do it:

1. **Open a text editor** (e.g., KWrite, Kate, or any text editor you prefer).
2. **Paste the following content** into the text editor, replacing the placeholders with your specific details:

      ```
      [Desktop Entry]
      Name=Obsidian
      Comment=Obsidian Note-taking app
      Exec=/path/to/Obsidian-1.6.7.AppImage
      Icon=/path/to/icon.png
      Terminal=false
      Type=Application
      Categories=Utility;
      ```

      - **Name:** The name that will appear on the desktop icon.
      - **Comment:** A brief description of the application.
      - **Exec:** The full path to your AppImage file.
      - **Icon:** The path to an icon file (optional, but recommended for a better look). You can download an icon from the web or use a placeholder icon.
      - **Terminal:** Set this to `false` if the app doesn't need a terminal to run.
      - **Type:** Set this to `Application`.
      - **Categories:** This helps categorize the application in your menu; adjust as needed.
3. **Save the file** with a `.desktop` extension, e.g., `obsidian.desktop`. You can save it to your Desktop or any location you prefer.
4. Open a terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `.desktop` file (e.g., `Desktop`):
     ```bash
     cd ~/Desktop
     ```
   - Run the following command to make it executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x obsidian.desktop
     ```
