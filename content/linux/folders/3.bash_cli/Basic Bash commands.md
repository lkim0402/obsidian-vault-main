# Basic Commands

- Executing multiple commands
	- Just add a semicolon
	- `command1; command2;`
		- can optionally omit the last ;
	- `echo -n 'Hello'; echo 'World'`

- `echo`
	- allows us to output text in the terminal
	- string wrapped in **single quotes**
	- `echo -n 'I love Bash'`
		- `echo` -> command
		- `-n` -> option(s)
		- `I love Bash` -> argument(s)
	- options
		- `-n`
			- by default, it will output a line break at the end
			- we can disable this with the option `-n`
		- `-e`
			- enables backlash escapes 
			- `echo -e 'Line \nLine2'`
	-  (you can combine options
		- `echo -en 'I love Bash!\n'` (order x matter mostly, depends on the command)
		- `echo -e -n 'I love Bash!\n'`
- `pwd` 
	- print working directory -> gives us current directory
	- certain shells might be configured in a way that they show us the current directory we're at
		- `leejun@leejun-VirtualBox:~$` -> the ~ tells us that we're rn in our home directory (our user folder) . Can be configured.
- `cd [directory_name]`
	- change directory
	- just `~` -> user home directory (like `/home/leejun)
		- `cd ~/Desktop`
	- `cd /` 
		- going into the absolute root folder path where everything starts
	- `cd ..`
		- going up to parent
	- cd `../..`
		- going up 2 parents
	- `cd ~` or `cd`
		- always goes to user's home directory (no matter where you are)
- `ls`
	- prints the contents of working directory
	- `ls [options..] [path]`
	- options
		- `-a`: lists all entries including hidden files
		- `-r`: reverse order while sorting
		- `-t`: sort by modification time, newest first
		- `-l`: long format (includes timestamp)
		- `--color={always,never,auto}`: enables colorful output (enabled in ubuntu by default)
	- Can also specify a path we want to list
		- `ls -ta --color ~/Desktop`
		- `ls ready/`
## Getting help
- `--help/ -h`
	- a built-in "usage" of the command, and not all commands implement it, or at least not the same way
	- just add this after the command
	- `ls -h`
	- shows possible list of args
- `man`
	- a command by itself which is a pager program that reads manual
	- `man ls`
	- man pages (documentation) must be installed on your system!
	- (it seems like ppl usually prefer `man` than `help`)
## File Management
- `touch`
	- create 1 or more empty file(s)
	- `touch test1.txt test2.txt`
	- actual use case
		- it modifies the timestamp of a file!
		- if file alr exists, only its timestamp will be modified. Otherwise, a new (and empty) file is created!
	- use `.` to create hidden files
- `mkdir`
	- creates a new directory
- `mv <file> <destination>/ `
	- moves an existing file to another location
		- `mv test.txt folder/`
	- can also be used to rename an existing file
		- `mv test.txt test2.txt`
	- both at once
		- `mv text.txt folder/test2.txt`
- `cp`
	- copy existing file(s)
	- `cp -R` : copies a whole folder
	- `cp text1.txt text2.txt`
		- will **copy the contents of `text1.txt` into a new file called `text2.txt`**.
	- `cp text1.txt newFolder`
	- `cp text1.txt newFolder/text2.txt`
- `rm`
	- removes a file(s)
	- for deleting a directory, use the option `-r`
		- works for empty and non-empty directories
	- deletes it PERMANENTLY
- `rmdir`
	- removes empty directory (way safer than `rm -r`)
- `tree`
	- shows tree structure
- `find`
	- provide path as first parameter
	- we get a list of all the files & folders in the path/folder (ex. `find .`)
	- filter: type
		- `find . -type f` (type file - f, type directory - d)
	- filter: modification within the last 7 days
		- `find . -type f -mtime-7`
	- filter: files larger than 10MB
		- `find . -type f -size +10M`
	- delete all empty files in a directory
		- `find . -empty -delete`
## File Management - text
- `cat`
	- allows to print the contents of a file
	- can actually kinda print binary data (but it might not work properly or break the terminal)
	- might cut the top parts of the file if file too big
- `head`
	- shows the start of a text file
	- we can specify the Parameter `-n` for the number of lines
	- `head -n 5 data.txt`
- `tail`
	- read file from the end
	- same options as `head`
	- `tail -n 5 data.txt`
- `less`
	- we can use this to read large files
	- arrow keys - navigate through the tile
	- f (forward) and b (backward) - navigate a whole page ahead or back 
	- `50p` - navigating to percentage of our content (ex. to 50%)
	- `=`  - shows our current progress
	- `-N` - shows rows
	- search
		- `/search term` - forward search
		- `?search term` - backward search
	- `q` - quit
	- waaay more options but these are the most important
- `wc`
	- usually used to check if file is big or not (with the `-l` flag)
	- `wc file.txt` -> same as `wc -lwc file.txt`
	- number of lines, words, bytes
	- can use `-l, -w, -c` flags separately (most important flags)
- `du` (disk usage)
	- calculates the size of all items in the folder (or we can pass in a file name as parameter)
	- `du -s` - to get summary
	- `du romeo.txt`
	- the unit depends (`-b` for bytes, `-k` for kilobytes, `-h` for human readable format)
		- ubuntu usually tells the side in kb w/o the flags
## Editing files w/ nano
- nano
	- no built in text editor for bash, so we have to install additional software for that
	- 4 popular options
		- pico / nano (upgraded ver of pico) - simple editor for text files in bash
		- vi / vim (upgraded ver of vi) - more advanced text editor
	- Install process depends on the system you're using
- `nano text.txt`
	- creates new file if it doesn't exist
- `Ctrl + O` - write out/save
