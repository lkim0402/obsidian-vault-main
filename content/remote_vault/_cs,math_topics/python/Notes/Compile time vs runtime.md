- **Compile time**
	- the period when the source code is converted into machine code
	- checks for syntax errors
	- compiler may optimize the code to make it more efficient before producing the final machine code
- **Runtime**
	- the period when the compiled program is actually being executed by the [[Operating systems (OS)|operating system]]
	- The machine code or bytecode (for Java, which is run by a virtual machine JVM) is loaded into [[PC#RAM (Memory)|memory (RAM)]] and run by the [[PC#CPU (Processor)|processor]] (or a [[Installing VirtualBox|VM]])
### **The process**
- source code
- (**Compile time**) compiler converts to machine code
- (**Runtime/Execution**) machine code is executed by the CPU at runtime, or bytecode is interpreted/executed by a virtual machine.
