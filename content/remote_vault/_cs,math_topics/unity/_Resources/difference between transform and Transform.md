- **`Transform`**: This is a class in Unity. [It defines the blueprint for the transform component, which includes properties and methods to manipulate an object’s position, rotation, and scale in the game world](https://discussions.unity.com/t/what-are-the-main-differences-between-transform-and-transform/508739)[1](https://discussions.unity.com/t/what-are-the-main-differences-between-transform-and-transform/508739)[2](https://discussions.unity.com/t/difference-between-transform-vs-transform/70353).
    
- **`transform`**: This is an instance of the `Transform` class. [When you use `transform` in your script, you’re referring to the specific `Transform` component attached to the GameObject that the script is attached to](https://discussions.unity.com/t/what-are-the-main-differences-between-transform-and-transform/508739)[1](https://discussions.unity.com/t/what-are-the-main-differences-between-transform-and-transform/508739)[2](https://discussions.unity.com/t/difference-between-transform-vs-transform/70353).
    
Think of it like this: `Transform` is the recipe, and `transform` is the actual cake made from that recipe. The `Transform` class provides the instructions, while `transform` is the specific instance of those instructions applied to a GameObject.
