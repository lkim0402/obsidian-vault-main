- `Time.deltaTime`
	- interval in seconds from the last frame to the current one (duration of 1 frame)
	- Can tell us how long each frame took to execute
	- When we multiply something by `Time.deltaTime` it makes out game "frame rate independent"
	- Example: On Update (each frame), move 1 unit to the left
		- Slow computer: 10 fps, so duration of 1 frame is 0.1s
			- Distance per second: 1 unit * 10 fps * 0.1 deltaTime = 1
		- Fast computer: 100 fps, so duration of 1 frame is 0.01s
			- Distance per second: 1 unit * 100 fps * 0.01 deltaTime = 1
		- So both dps is 1 	
- `Time.time`
	- The amount of time that elapses
