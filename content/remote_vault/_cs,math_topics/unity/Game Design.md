	- Core Mechanics
		- Move and dodge?

	- You might have loooots of questions, but just ask yourself first: "What is the core mechanic?"
		- What is the most important thing for your game that without it it's not your game anymore?
		- Then figure out the 2nd, 3rd most important stuff
	- All other layers need to be feeding in the core layer to make it better
	- For example, for my rocket game,it would be
		1. Movement/flying
		2. World collision
		3. Level progression

### Useful game design approach
-  Design "moments" and then expand them into a level.
- Moments that use the environment
	- Fly under
	- Fly over
	- Fly through a (moving) gap
	- Time your flight through moving obstacles
	- Land on a moving platform
	- Fly through long narrow tunnel

### When to tune your gameplay
- You add feature 
- Then fix thosebugs
- Then tune the gameplay
- Then playtest it, tune, gamepla, tune (repeat)
- Then add new feature
- Repeat
