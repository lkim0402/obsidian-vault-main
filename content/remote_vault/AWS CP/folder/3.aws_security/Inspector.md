>Amazon Inspector automatically discovers workloads and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure

- Automatically scan your resources across all your accounts for vulnerabilities + surfaces the problems to you so you can take action
- Scans [[EC2|EC2 instances]] and [[Containers|containers]], tells which instance(s)/container(s) and what vulnerability was detected
- Great for avoiding attacks!
