- Automatically add/remove EC2 instances based on certain conditions you set
- Ensures sufficient capacity at all times, without over-provisioning
- Scaling - "adding more instances"
## Creating an Auto Scaling Group
- `EC2 console >  Auto Scaling Groups`
- You create a group of rules that will ensure that a certain amount of EC2 instances are running based on certain conditions
	- Choose a **launch template**
		- a feature that tells AWS how your [[EC2|EC2 instances]] should be configured
		- since we won't be creating them manually
		- Creating a launch template -> same with EC2 launch wizard
		- You need to choose [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)|VPCs and subnets]] that can be used for launching
	- Choose a load balancer ([[Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)]]) + target group
		- make sure u choose the same [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)|VPCs and subnets]] that you chose in the previous step
		- Set up the rule for which kind of requests you want to listen
			- ex. HTTPs requests
			- Create a new target group - a collection of instances (EC2, containers, IP addresses, etc.) that receive traffic from a load balancer 
				- group of instances that will be used for forwarding requests to
			- If a load balancer is connected to an auto scaling group, then it will automatically add all instances that are created by that auto scaling group to this target group
		- Health check
			- is an instance healthy - capable of receiving requests
	- Choose Auto scaling conditions
		- set the capacities you want to have for your instances
			- desired capacity - the default capacity you want to have
			- minimum/maximum capacity
		- scaling policy
			- define the metric where you want to scale up
			- CPU utilization, network, etc
	- Choose notifs
		- maybe an email so you know when an instance is added
	- Tags
		- identify resources
