>A very simplified [[EC2]] management console

- Makes using [[EC2]] WAY easier
- It's AWS' try to target customers who search a simple web hosting solution (primarily).
- Pick a goal, and create the infrastructure for that goal
- gives you even less configuration options than [[Elastic Beanstalk]]
- Makes you focus on tasks
	- ex. If you want to host a WordPress application, LightSail gives you this specific use case. Then LightSail can launch an EC2 instance with WordPress pre-installed on it
