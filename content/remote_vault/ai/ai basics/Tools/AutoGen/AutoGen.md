> An open source programming framework used for building AI agents that can **communicate** and **cooperate** with other agents to solve tasks

> Makes it super easy to make advanced applications using multiple agents, including AI models, tools and humans
# Main features
- Enables building next-gen LLM applications easier through multi-agent conversations
	- Simplifies automation, orchestration
	- Optimization of complex LLM workflows
	- Minimizes LLM weaknesses (boost LLM performance)
- Supports diverse conversation patterns for complex workflows
	- Has customizable and conversational agents
	- Devs can build various types of conversation patterns
- Provides a collection of working systems already (of varying complexity)
	- The devs can just use them or learn from them
- Easy to use
- Flexible conversations (various conversations styles)
- Abstracts all complexities of interaction between agents
