- Most [[Linux Distributions]] offer a centralized way to install software -> use a **package manager** to install, update, and remove software from a centralized repository
- Package manager ensures to keep our system up to date
	- ENOURMOUS benefit of many linux systems
	- A lot of applications no longer need to include their own updater
- How does it work?
	- Our system connects to centralized repositories
	- They provide a list of available packages (including available versions, and their dependencies)
	- The package manager fetches this list and ensures smooth installation/upgrades.
- Slightly different for each distribution
	- but main idea remains the same

### In Debian-based distros (ex. Ubuntu)
- We use tool `apt` to keep system up to date & manage our software
	- related: [[Basic Bash commands#Sudo|sudo]]
	- `sudo apt update`
		- refreshes the list of available packages
		- should run this before doing anything else with apt
		- should use `sudo` because you're accessing directories owned by root\
	- `sudo apt upgrade`
		- runs a small upgrade of our system
		- small -> upgrades existing packages (and when using `apt`, also allows the install of additional dependencies)
		- X destroys anything
		- Other ways to upgrade
			- `sudo apt full-upgrade / sudo apt dist-upgrade`
			- large upgrade -> upgrades existing packages, removes/installs additional packages (dependencies)
			- potentially destroy/remove stuffs
	- `apt autoremove`
		- removes packages that are no longer needed
		- you can run this if there's any errors during an upgrade or full-upgrade
	- `apt install [package]`
	- `apt remove [package]`
	- You can use `apt-get` for update and upgrade (won't install additional dependencies)
