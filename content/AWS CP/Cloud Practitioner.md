# Getting Started
- [[Basics - Course Supplement]]
- What is AWS?
	- AWS is a company - Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon (amazon.com)
	- It is a Cloud Computing Services Provider

- Self Service & Managed Services 
	- Two main kinds of services
		- You can mix & match different services as you need
	- Self Service
		- Do it yourself
		- EC2 - configure and launch a server -> only the hardware is managed by AWS
	- Managed Services
		- AWS manages the hard parts.
		- Partially configurable
		- Can be used together with other services (self-service)
- Service categories
	- https://aws.amazon.com/ > products
		- some services do show up multiple times in different categories
		- some listed things aren't actually services but features (lol)
	- Group
		![[Pasted image 20250314203226.png]]
		- The groups solve different problems & do different workloads
