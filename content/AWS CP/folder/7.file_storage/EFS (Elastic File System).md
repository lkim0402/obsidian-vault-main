- Features
	- We also get a hard drive, but we don't care about the actual configs
	- Think of it like a **shared folder in the cloud** that multiple computers (EC2 instances) can read and write to **simultaneously**.
	- We get a scalable pre-formatted file system, which uses hard drives under the hood
	- We can structure the file system as we need (via cmd or code)
	- Ex. we can create a file system in the [[EC2|EC2 instance]]
- Not limited to [[EC2|EC2 instances]] unlike [[EBS (Elastic Block Store)]]
	- can be used with multiple services
	- X work alone
- A regional service
	- focusing on [[AWS Infrastructure (Regions, AZs, Edge locations)#Region|specific region]] & [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)|VPC]]
- Scaling
	- Built to scale automatically
- Config
	- A file system is an [[Permissions & Access Control (IAM)#Types of identities|identity]]
	- Which type of application workload the file system should be optimized for (read/write, writing big files, throughput, etc)
	- You don't choose any size/scaling settings (it scales automatically!)
	- Encryption option - how the files should be encrypted automatically
	- network access for the file system - which [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)|VPC]] it belongs + which [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)#Subnets|subnets]] it should be able to reach (useful if ur running instances in specific subnets) + [[Security groups|security groups]]
	- access policy
		- which kind of data can be written into this file system
- Resources

	- [[File storage#EBS vs EFS|EBS vs EFS]]
