- Almost all workloads generate some data, and often the data should be stored in files (or databases)
	- files generated by applications 
		- ex. web app) user uploads, invoices, transformed images, etc
		- ex. analytics app) generated pdf reports
	- file archiving
		- ex. business) account related, legal docs, etc
# Different kinds of file storage
- AWS has one service for every kind of file storage

#### Block storage
- [[EBS (Elastic Block Store)]]
- Attaching a (virtual) hard drive to a [[Backend Explained#Server|server]]
	- Unformatted hard drive you attach 
	- Once you attach it,  you have to format & structure it before you can use it
	- For [[EC2|EC2 instances]], you attach a block storage device, and from in the instance you mount the hard drive and format it. 
	- Then you can create a custom structure and use it like any other hard drive to create a file system
#### Object storage
- [[S3 (Simple Storage Service)]]
- The idea
	- Store & retrieve files, focus on the individual files themselves
	- Any kind of file w/ any size
	- Doesn't care about underlying system/hard drive/file system where the file gets stored
	- no custom structure/file system
#### File system
- [[EFS (Elastic File System)]]
- [[FXs]]
- A **file system** lets you **organize, store, and share files**.
	- Think of it like a **shared folder in the cloud** that multiple computers (EC2 instances) can read and write to **simultaneously**.
- Network file system where you can attach multiple devices (ex. ec2 instances)
- You don't want to care about the underlying hard drive
- Preformatted file system, n that system you can create custom structures & files
- X care about hard drive or objects, care about the file system
- You can attach to different services, then you can store files as well

# EBS vs EFS

- [[EBS (Elastic Block Store)]] = A USB drive → One computer at a time can use it.
- [[EFS (Elastic File System)]]  = A Google Drive folder → Multiple people (EC2 instances) can access and edit files at the same time.
