>- Elastic Container/Kubernetes Services
>	- ECS is AWSâ€™s simpler container orchestrator, letting you define tasks and services without the complexity of Kubernetes.

- Services for running [[Containers|containerized workloads]] on AWS -> u want to run images
- Managed container orchestration with many configuration options
- Handles cluster management, container deployment, scaling, and health monitoring
- Alternative to [[EC2]] (not recommended)
- Perfect to fun any kind of containerized workloads

- Define cluster structure
	- You have to define your cluster structure = the infrastructure environment where containers run
	- Which kind of infrastructure?
		- you could use [[EC2|EC2 instances]] or [[Fargate]] as container host
		- [[EC2|EC2 instances]] -> these instances will be started and operated by ECS/EKS (and you won't manage them manually). But you still have to set instance settings when you create a EC2/EKS
		- [[Fargate]] -> recommended
	- Tasks: which image you should use & other image configs
	- Network & security settings
- Operate & scale containers
	- you can define service/task specific settings
		- Need to select a **Task definitions** u want to use first 
		- service - ongoing task (ex. web servers)
		- task - tasks finish at some time
	- monitor containers
	- stop/start
	- schedule tasks (ex. once everyday), or have something running all day (ex. web server)
#### Task definitions / Task / Service
- A JSON file that describes:
	- Which container image(s) to use
	- How much CPU and memory to allocate
	- Which ports to expose
	- What environment variables to set
	- How containers should communicate with each other
	- Storage volumes to mount
	- Network settings
	- LIKE A BLUEPRINT
- Task / service
	- you can create them by referencing the task definitions you created
	- Each cluster can run multiple tasks/services -> Tasks/services are at the cluster level
	- **Task**: An instance of a task definition running on your cluster (the actual running containers
	- **Service**: A configuration that maintains a specified number of tasks running at all times (for long-running applications like web servers)
- So when you're in the AWS Management Console:
	- You create task definitions first (the blueprint)
	- Then you run tasks or create services based on those task definitions
- Analogy
	- Task definition = Recipe
	- Task = Meal prepared from that recipe
	- Service = Chef who keeps making that meal whenever it's consumed
#### Typical workflow
1. **You build your container image** using Docker on your development machine or in a CI/CD pipeline
2. **You push that image to a container registry** like [[ECR (Elastic Container Registry)]], Docker Hub, or another registry
3. **You define how to run your container** using:
    - ECS: Task definitions and services
    - EKS: Kubernetes manifests (deployments, services, etc.)
4. **ECS/EKS pulls your image** from the registry and runs it on the underlying infrastructure

#### Cluster
>ECS/EKS manage **clusters of infrastructure** (the compute resources)
- A collection of infrastructure resources (servers/compute), managed as a single unit
- Can run many [[Containers|containers]] across multiple machines
- Provides the environment where containers run
- Handles scheduling, networking, and management
- The relationship w/ containers is hierarchical:
	- A cluster contains many nodes (servers/instances)
	- Each node can run multiple containers
	- The cluster orchestrates how containers are distributed across nodes
