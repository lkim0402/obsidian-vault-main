### The implications ML can solve
1. The system has capacity to learn patterns  (often complex)
	- Not useful when you can just look up through a relational database, but useful when there is potential to actually learn, like predicting Airbnb pricings from characteristics (date, size, etc)
	- You have to let the ML system figure out the pattern![[Pasted image 20240827152752.png]]
2. There is existing data / It's possible to collect data
	- Sometimes ML models are deployed without having been trained so that they will learn from incoming data in production. This is risky. (Fake it till make it)
3. Solving problems that require predictive answers
4. Unseen data
	- Your unseen data and training data should come from similar distributions.

### Additional good-to-have
1. Repetition
	- When a pattern is repeated multiple times, it's easier for machines to learn from it
2. The cost of wrong predictions is cheap
	- If the ML model recommends an item the user isn't interested in, the user simply won't click it. But if the ML model makes a wrong move in an autonomous vehicle, it's deadly (but it's still wildly being developed since the good - if achieved - outweighs the bad significantly) 
3. It's at scale
	-  Making LOTS of predictions (ex. include sorting through millions of emails a year or predicting which departments thousands of support tickets should be routed to a day. )
	- Having a problem at scale also means that thereâ€™s a lot of data for you to collect, which is useful for training ML models.
4. Constantly changing patterns
	- You can't code/handwrite every single rule to the changing pattern, let your ML model learn from it!

### Cases in real life
> ML systems serve both internal and external
> - Internal: reducing costs, generating customer insight, internal processing automation
> - External: improving customer experience, customer interaction
- Fraud detection
- Price optimization
- Churn prediction (predicting when a specific customer is about to stop using your products or services so that you can take appropriate actions to win them back)
- Brand monitoring (monitoring how the public/customers view your brand)

Example (from Andrew Ng's course)
- In a phone factory, there may be an edge device (Device living inside a factory that manufactures the smartphones)  which has an inspection software that detects if there is a scratch. It controls a camera which takes picture, then passes the picture to a prediction server which returns
- You will put the CV model you made in the prediction server, set API interfaces, and write software to deploy this DL algorithm into production
