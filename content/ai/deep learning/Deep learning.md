- Logistics of the course
	- Types of lecture
		- Theory/math: Take notes on paper (on hand than on laptop)
		- Coding: Follow along with code, pause video, explore, experiment, take notes in code. Will use PyTorch
		- Exercises: You have to be actively engaged!
			- Code Challenge - familiarity & critical thinking
			- Milestones  - larger projects, start "from scratch"
			- Additional explorations - suggestions/inspiration for continued exploration of models and data (optional, but great!!!!!)
