- AI tools analysis
	- too much noise and hype around 1000s of different tools
	- every major tech company claims to have the "best" AI tool, and each platform has multiple models
	- Which AI tools can cover my essential need? -> what's the smallest set of AI tools that will cover all my essential needs?
		1. Spot your RECURRING need
			- ex. A faster way to research advertising trends
			- what do i want?

				- summarize research papers
		2. Find your tool
		3. Master one tool
- Prompt
	- Keep a folder/notes for prompts database

- Update suffocation
	- overwhelming, unending flood of AI information
	- LEARN
		- to stay competitive, u need to stay updated, but be selective
		- just pick 1-2 sources!
		- 5-10 mins per day
	- TAKE ACTION
		- ex. 1hr every week to actually experiment with ONE THING that you learned
		- taking action and implementing something you've learned is infinitely more valuable than hrs of passive consumption
