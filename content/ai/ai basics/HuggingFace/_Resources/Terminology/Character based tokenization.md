- Splits text into individual characters (not words).
	- While there are many words, the number of characters is limited and finite. (An advantage over [[Word-based tokenization]])
- Out-of-vocabularies less frequent
- **Libraries**:
	- **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**: Can implement custom character-level tokenizers.
	- **Hugging Face**: Supports character-level tokenization through specific models.
- Limitation
	- A character do not hold as much information individually as a word would (at least in the english language)
	- Their sequences are very long to be processed by the model
