- Most popular languages are OOP
	- [[Python]], C, [[C++]]
- It is a method of programming that attempts to model some process or thing in the world as a **class** or **object**
- A VERY NICE TO HAVE WAY OF THINKING
### Classes/Objects
- Class
	- Blueprints for objects.
	- Contains methods (functions) and attributes (similar to keys in a dict)
- Object
	- Instances of classes
	- Objects constructed from a class blueprint that contain their class's methods and properties

### Example: Deck of cards

- private
	- use underscore in front of variable (convention)
	- python has no strict enforcement of private variables (like other languages such as C#)

### Encapsulation
> Grouping of public and private attributes/methods into a programmatic class, making **abstraction** possible
- Key aspects
	- Data hiding - protects an objects data/internal state from outside
		- exposing only what's necessary
	- public interfaces
		- functions that allow interaction with external code
- Not exposing information as much as possible - the bare minimum, keep it "encapsulated"

### Abstraction
> Exposing only the relevant data in a class interface, hiding the private attributes and methods (the "inner workings") from users
