- To fix an error, you have to understand them!
- `SyntaxError`
	- wrong syntax (can't parse), usually just typos
- `NameError`
	- variable is not defined (not assigned yet)
- `TypeError`
	- an operation or function is applied to the wrong type
	- argument is missing when calling the function
	- `len(5) # integer has no length`
- `IndexError`
	- you tried to access an element in a list using an invalid index
- `ValueError`
	- a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value
	- `int("foo") # ValueError`
	- `int("5") # 5`
- `KeyError`
	- occurs when a dict doesn't have the key
- `AttributeError`
	- variable doesn't have an attribute
	- `"awesome".foo() # AttributeError`
