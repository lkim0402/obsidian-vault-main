> A "repo" is a **git workspace** which tracks and manages files within a folder.

- We should create a new git repository anytime we want to use Git with a project, app, etc 
- We can have as many repos on our machine!
- Every git repo has its own history/contents

- If you want to use git, go in each project folder and create a git repo
