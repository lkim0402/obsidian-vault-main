- Git docs officially recommends you use **present tense**, imperative style commit msg
- "make xyz do this" instead of "I changed xyz to do this"
- as if you're giving orders lol

- But it doesn't really matter and it often depends on the organization/project/personal preferences, just be consistent

- Your commit msg may be super long!!!
	- bullet points, summary, detailed explanation, etc
	- In this case, just use a text editor through `git commit`
