> The world's most popular version control system (VCS)
	- VCS: A software that tracks and manages changes to files over time
	- Git is just one of many VCS
- It is primarily a **terminal tool**
	- We can use it in the terminal and with a GUI
#### GUIs VS Command Line
- GUIs include Github Desktop, GitKraken, etc
- GUIs
	- Pros: easy
	- Cons
		- "magic" -> can click without understanding things and things may go wrong quickly
		- dependence on a particular piece of software
- Command Line
	- Pros
		- all documentation leads to cmd
		- way faster
		- some new commands/features only exist in the cmd 
	- Cons
		- not beginner friendly
		- even for experienced users the cmd can be unfriendly
#### Things it helps us
- track changes
- compare versions of a project
- "time travel" to old versions
- collaborate and share changes
- combine changes

#### Users
- Engineers + programmers (like...all literally companies)
- Tech-adjacent roles 
- Governments

	- government.github.com
- Scientists, research teams
	- Manage code, datasets, and more
- Writers!
	- Uses to manage drafts of complex novels, screenplays, or other works with lots of moving parts
