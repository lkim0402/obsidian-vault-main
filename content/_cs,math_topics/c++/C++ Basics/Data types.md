> A **data type** (more commonly just called a **type**) determines what kind of value (e.g. a number, a letter, text, etc…) an object will store.

- Types of objects must be known at **compile time** so the compiler knows how much memory that object requires).
- The type cannot be changed without recompiling the program

### Types
- `int`
	- integer value
	- number written w/o a fractional component
	- `4`, `0`, `-98`
- `double`

- You can create your custom types
