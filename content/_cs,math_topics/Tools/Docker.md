### Opening Docker file in VS Code
##### 1. **Install the Remote - Containers Extension**
- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- Search for "Remote - Containers" and click **Install**.
##### 2. **Access the Container**
- Make sure the Docker container you want to access is running.
- You can verify the running containers using:`docker ps`
##### 3. **Open the Container in VS Code**
- Once the "Remote - Containers" extension is installed, you can open the container in VS Code directly.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
- Type "Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container..." and select it.
- You will see a list of running containers. Select the container you want to access (`llm` in your case).
##### 4. **Browse the Files**
- After attaching to the container, VS Code will open a new window connected to the container's file system.
- You can now browse, edit, and manage files inside the Docker container just like you would with any local project.
##### 5. **Work with the Files**
- You can create, modify, and save files directly within the container using VS Code.
- Any changes you make will be reflected inside the Docker container.
##### 6. **(Optional) Use a Dockerfile for Development**
- If you have a Dockerfile and want to open a development environment based on that Dockerfile, you can use the "Remote - Containers: Reopen in Container" command from the Command Palette and select your Dockerfile or Docker Compose file.
