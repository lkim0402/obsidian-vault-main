> Photonic quantum computing is a type of quantum computing that uses photons—particles of light—as the primary information carriers, or qubits. Unlike traditional quantum computing, which often uses other particles like electrons or atoms to encode quantum bits, photonic quantum computing relies on the quantum properties of light.

- There's no easy way to entangle them once you've created them because the photons don't interact with each other
- Standard approach is gate based, but [[PsiQuantum]] used measurement-based approach
	- Other companies are switching to this method
