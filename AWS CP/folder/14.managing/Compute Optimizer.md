>[!Compute optimizer]
>- Optimizes [[Compute services|compute]] resources
>- uses [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] to analyze [[CloudWatch]] metrics & resource configurations
>	- then provides config improvement recommendations 
## Motivation
- No matter which kind of [[Compute services|compute]] tasks you're running in the cloud, you're using either [[EC2|EC2 instances]], [[containers]], or [[Lambda|Lambda functions]]
- Easy to choose wrong config when using one of these solutions
	- ex. choosing the config too powerful/insufficient
- chooses better alternatives
