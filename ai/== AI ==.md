# What is AI
![[Pasted image 20250214213503.png|200]]
- Artificial intelligence
	- machines that perform jobs that mimic human behavior
	- performs tasks that typically requires human intelligence
		- problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language
	- simulate (mimic aspects, resembles behavior)
	- NOT emulate (replicates exact processes and mechanisms)
- [[Machine Learning]]
	- machines that get better at a task without explicit programming
- [[Deep learning]]
	- machines that have an artificial neural network inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems
- GenAI
	- a specialized subset of AI that generates out content (image, video, text, audio)
	- can interpret or analyze data but also generate new data itself
	- often involves advanced ml techniques
		- GANs, VAEs, transformer models (GPT)
	- multiple modalities
		- vision, text, audio, molecular

- [[NLP (Natural Language Processing)]]
### AI Tools
- JupyterLab
	- next-generation web-based user interface
	- has all features of the classic Jupyter Notebook in a flexible and powerful user interface
		- notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser
- [[AutoGen]]
- [[Google Cloud]]
- [[HuggingFace]]
- [[LangChain]]
- [[LangGraph]]
