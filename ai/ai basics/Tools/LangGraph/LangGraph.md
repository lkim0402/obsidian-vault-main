> A new package within [[LangChain|LangChain's]] ecosystem that allows us to build customized agents and achieve complex tasks.
> Building language agents with graphs; The entire lofic/flow of the agent can be expressed as a graph

	- Allows devs to define the scope which the LLM is going to be used within our agent
- We can achieve this in [[LangChain]] but doing it in LangGraph is much more abstract and flexible, and actually create a full cycle
