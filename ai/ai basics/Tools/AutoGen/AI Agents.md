#### What are they:![[Pasted image 20240812160317.png]]
- A software entity that uses AI techniques to autonomously perform tasks or make decisions on behalf of a user 
- **A combination of all tools needed and the LLM that reasons and gets the task done (which the LLM can't do on its own)**
- Agent is designed to interact with their environment, process input, and provide outputs based on the data they receive and the goals they're supposed to achieve

#### Key characteristics
- Autonomy
	- No human intervention by nature
	- But we can also add human input as well
- Learning and adaptation
	- Learn from experiences and adapt their behavior over time
	- Usualy achieved through ML techniques
- Interactions
	- AI agents should be able to interact with their environment (other software systems, databases, human users, etc)
- Goal driven
	- Typically designed with specific goals/tasks in mind
#### Examples
- Example 1
