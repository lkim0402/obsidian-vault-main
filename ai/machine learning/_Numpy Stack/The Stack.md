- [[NumPy]]
- [[Matplotlib]]
- scipy
- pandas

- This course is made to put the theory of [[Machine Learning]] into code
	- code along format
- How to practice and apply what you've learned
	- The purpose of this course is to learn the BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS to do ACTUAL MACHINE LEARNING
	- Go out, learn [[Machine Learning]], and implement those algorithms!!
	- If you can't implement it, then y ou don't understand it!

- Numpy - the core
	- It gives the numpy array
		- the fundamental data structure that can represent vectors, matrices, and multidimensional tensors
		- the raw materials data scientists work with
- matplotlib - data visualization
- SciPy - statistics
- pandas - reading, writing, manipulating efficiently
