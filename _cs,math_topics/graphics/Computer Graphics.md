- Which language?
	- Mainly C++
	- You write code for the CPU usually in C++, and also write code for the GPU (shader code) in a high level shading language such as such as HLSL or GLSL
		- You also need a way to tie them both together, asking the CPU to ask the GPU to do something useful using shaders and the other data and metadata needed to make that happen
- [[C++]]
