- 프론트엔드 CI/CD
	- nextjs
	- k8s
- express/nest 기반 백엔드
- websocket
- SSR Nextjs
- e2e playwright

- package managers (npm, yarn)

> The trend is that the frontend and backend will merge.. so prepare to do both
# The BAREBONE Basics (only scratches the surface) 
> == From Freecodecamp ==
> Responsive design, state management

Frontend
1. Understand how the internet functions
	- domains, domain name system, servers, protocols (e.g. HTTP)
	- basic comprehension of web browsers & how they render web pages
2. Fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JS
	- HTML - semantic HTML
	- CSS - box model, animation/transitions, flexbox, grid, responsiveness
	- JS - var vs let vs const, arrays, objects, functions, fetch api, asynchronous code (promises/async,await), DOM/web platform (events, manipulation) 
3. Responsive design and CSS frameworks
	- media queries, using % instead of hard-coded values
	- CSS frameworks = pre-written CSS stylesheets that provides a collection of reusable components
		- Bootstrap, Foundation, Tailwind
		- grid systems (ready made grid systems), responsive utilities, component libraries (pre-styled components -> buttons, cards, etc)
4. JS frameworks
	- Most popular frontend frameworks: React, Vue, Angular
	- Reusable functionality that you build
	- other things: routing and navigation, state management, form validation, etc
	- each framework has100s of hrs of tutorials (just use react lmao)
	- largest learning block here 
5. TYPESCRIPT (mandatory)
	- Basic types, inference, types vs interface, generics
6. API integration & Asynchronous JS
	- interaction with real world data, provided by backend
	- JS is single threaded & asynchronous 
	- Restful API
		- Traditional restful apis come with limitations
	- GraphQL emerges as a powerful alternative
		- allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over fecthing
7. Testing and debugging
	- developer tools -> you can edit the DOM
	- boring but must needed
	- reusable tests
		1. Unit: tests individual components/functions
		2. Integration: tests interactions between different components/modules
		3. End-to-end (E2E) testing: evaluates the entire flow and functionality
	- Jest - unit testing
	- Cypress - end to end testing
8. Byte - front end tooling solution that offers faster build times
	- module bundling, transpilation, minification
9. TypeScript
	- master js first
	- static typing - offers type annotations, interfaces, and enhanced tooling
10. Web security
	- OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) provides guidelines and best practices to ensure web application security
11. Server rendered React applications
	- Next.js
		- automatic code splitting
		- server side rendering
	- Astro
		- less JS by default, so faster load times
12. Optimization
	- performance is as important as aesthetics
	- optimizing images, leveraging browser caching, minimizing server response times
	- Google's Lighthouse
13. Cross platform mobile applications
	- React Native (ios and android)

Backend
- Next.js
	- Routing, server components, server actions, caching, SSR/SSG, Patterns and best practices (data fetching, server-side validation, avoid leaks, etc)
- Separate backend
	- Node.js (Express, Nest.js)
	- PHP (Laravel)
	- Java (Spring)
	- Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
	- Go
- Database
	- SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite) vs NoSQL (mongodb)
	- QRM (Prisma, Drizzle, Mongoose)
	- Hosted DB services (Supabase, Firebase, vercel)

React & Next.js Ecosystem
- ShadcnUI
- Zod
- React-Hook-Form
- Framer Motion
- Authentication (Next-Auth vs Kinde)
- Payments (Stripe, Kinde)
- Hosting providers (vercel)
- git and github
- mobile apps? (react native & expo)
# Web Dev in 2025
- 4 main overview changes
	- AI copilots, TypeScript (+Zod), Tailwind CSS, Next.js App Router
