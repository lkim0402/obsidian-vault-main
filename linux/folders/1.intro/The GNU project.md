> GNU = GNU's Not Unix
	- GNU is an [[Operating systems (OS)|operating system]]!!
#### Terminology
- **GNU Project** = The movement that started in 1983 to make a free OS.
- **GNU OS** = The planned full OS that never got finished because its kernel (**Hurd**) was incomplete.
- **GNU Software** = The tools (Bash, GCC, Coreutils, etc.) that were **meant to be part of the GNU OS**, but instead got used with the Linux kernel.
#### More info
- **Founded in 1983 by Richard Stallman** to create a _completely free_ (as in freedom) Unix-like operating system.
	- **Goal:** Make software that respects users' freedom (anyone can use, modify, and share it).
- basically what happened
	- Stallman wanted a free OS but didn't have a working kernel.
	- By the early 90s, GNU had built almost everything **except the kernel**.
	- Then **Linus Torvalds made the Linux kernel (1991)**, and people combined it with GNU tools to make complete Linux distros.
- Linux has become the de facto way to refer to GNU/Linux based operating systems
	- We get a unix-operating system

✅ **Linux Distro** = **Linux Kernel** + **GNU Software** + Other Stuff (GUI (like GNOME, KDE), package managers, etc.)
- **[[Linux Distributions|Linux distros]]** differentiate from each other primarily through the **"other stuff"**
#### GNU software
- refers to the tools and programs developed under the **GNU Project**. 
- The project itself is the larger movement, while GNU software includes things like:
	- **Bash** (the shell/command line you use)
	- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection, used for compiling C, C++, etc.)
	- **Coreutils** (basic Unix-like commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, etc.)
	- **GRUB** (bootloader that helps start up your OS)
- So when you see "GNU Software," just think of all the essential programs that make a Linux system usable. The Linux kernel alone isn’t enough—you need these GNU tools to interact with it.
